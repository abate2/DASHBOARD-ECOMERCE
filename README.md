This project is a template pretty useful to anyone that wants a dashboard for
 an ecomerce, it has several features as a reposive design focus in tablet and
mobile devices, with helping of javascript I got to give a dark style to the 
dashboard by using the button in the upper-right corner in the web page, also it
manages the data base of the orders in an independent way let us add different
 data without altering the original html.
